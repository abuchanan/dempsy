A crossword game written with AngularJS, node.js, socket.io, and probably mongoDB.

### Try it!

Sorry, this isn't simple to set up yet. Hopefully I can resolve that within the next couple days.

Requires node (tested with 0.10.x) and mongodb.

- `git clone https://github.com/abuchanan/dempsy.git`
- `cd dempsy`
- `npm install`
- `bower install` (choose angular 1.2.4 if you're asked to)
- (make sure mongodb is running)
- `node server.js`
- in another terminal, `node create_test_game.js`, and visit the URL it outputs.
